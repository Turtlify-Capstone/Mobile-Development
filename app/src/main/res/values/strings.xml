    <string name="our_mission_desc">We realise that some turtle and tortoise species are facing the threat of extinction, but public awareness about this issue is still very low. Many people often capture turtles and tortoises to keep as pets or for consumption, without paying attention to whether these species are protected or not. Furthermore, the issue of turtles being found in waters that should not be their habitat is also a crucial problem for the survival of these species. Turtlify provides easily accessible and engaging information about turtles and tortoises, So we can increase public awareness of the importance of protecting these species.</string>
